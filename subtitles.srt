1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,546
The

2
00:00:00,546 --> 00:00:01,092
air

3
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:01,639
was

4
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,185
thick

5
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:02,731
with

6
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:03,277
an

7
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,824
eerie

8
00:00:03,824 --> 00:00:04,370
mist

9
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,916
as

10
00:00:04,916 --> 00:00:05,463
Jane

11
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:06,009
crept

12
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:06,555
through

13
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:07,102
the

14
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:07,648
parted

15
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:08,194
iron

16
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:08,741
gates

17
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,287
of

18
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:09,833
the

19
00:00:09,833 --> 00:00:10,380
long-forgotten

20
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,926
Dingley

21
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:11,472
Dell

22
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:12,019
estate.

23
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:12,565
The

24
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:13,111
house,

25
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:13,658
once

26
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:14,204
a

27
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:14,750
prosperous

28
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,297
family

29
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:15,843
home,

30
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:16,389
stood

31
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:16,936
tall

32
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:17,482
but

33
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:18,028
neglected

34
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:18,575
-

35
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:19,121
a

36
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:19,667
forgotten

37
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,214
relic

38
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:20,760
of

39
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,306
a

40
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:21,853
bygone

41
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:22,399
era.

42
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:22,945
Vines

43
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:23,492
and

44
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:24,038
ivy

45
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:24,584
crawled

46
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,131
over

47
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:25,677
the

48
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:26,223
ancient

49
00:00:26,223 --> 00:00:26,770
bricks,

50
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,316
snaking

51
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:27,862
up

52
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:28,409
to

53
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:28,955
the

54
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:29,501
darkened

55
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,048
windows

56
00:00:30,048 --> 00:00:30,594
like

57
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:31,140
grasping

58
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,687
fingers.

59
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,233
The

60
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:32,779
front

61
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:33,326
porch

62
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:33,872
creaked

63
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:34,419
ominously,

64
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:34,965
as

65
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:35,511
if

66
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:36,058
beckoning

67
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:36,604
her.

68
00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:37,150
Inside,

69
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,697
the

70
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:38,243
walls

71
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:38,789
were

72
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,336
adorned

73
00:00:39,336 --> 00:00:39,882
with

74
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:40,428
cobwebs

75
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:40,975
and

76
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:41,521
dust-filled

77
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,067
antique

78
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:42,614
furniture,

79
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:43,160
and

80
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,706
faint,

81
00:00:43,706 --> 00:00:44,253
unsettling

82
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:44,799
whispers

83
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,345
echoed

84
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:45,892
around

85
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:46,438
every

86
00:00:46,438 --> 00:00:46,984
corner.

87
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:47,531
Jane

88
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,077
called

89
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:48,623
out

90
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:49,170
but

91
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:49,716
nobody

92
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,262
answered,

93
00:00:50,262 --> 00:00:50,809
only

94
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:51,355
the

95
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:51,901
distant

96
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:52,448
cawing

97
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:52,994
of

98
00:00:52,994 --> 00:00:53,540
a

99
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,087
lone,

100
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:54,633
roosting

101
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:55,179
crow.

102
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:55,726
As

103
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:56,272
she

104
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:56,818
ventured

105
00:00:56,818 --> 00:00:57,365
further

106
00:00:57,365 --> 00:00:57,911
into

107
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:58,457
the

108
00:00:58,457 --> 00:00:59,004
haunted

109
00:00:59,004 --> 00:00:59,550
halls,

110
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,096
she

111
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:00,643
found

112
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,189
herself

113
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,735
stumbling

114
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:02,282
through

115
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:02,828
a

116
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:03,374
passage

117
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:03,921
only

118
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:04,467
to

119
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,013
be

120
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:05,560
pushed

121
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,106
aside

122
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:06,652
by

123
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:07,199
an

124
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:07,745
invisible

125
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:08,291
force.

126
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:08,838
In

127
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:09,384
the

128
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:09,930
darkness,

129
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,477
she

130
00:01:10,477 --> 00:01:11,023
swore

131
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:11,569
she

132
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:12,116
could

133
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:12,662
hear

134
00:01:12,662 --> 00:01:13,208
footsteps

135
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:13,755
tapping

136
00:01:13,755 --> 00:01:14,301
on

137
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:14,847
the

138
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:15,394
hardwood

139
00:01:15,394 --> 00:01:15,940
flooring

140
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,486
in

141
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,033
the

142
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:17,579
distance,

143
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,125
and

144
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:18,672
the

145
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:19,218
chill

146
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:19,764
that

147
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:20,311
ran

148
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:20,857
down

149
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:21,403
her

150
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:21,950
spine

151
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,496
illuminated

152
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,042
the

153
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:23,589
path

154
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:24,135
to

155
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:24,681
the

156
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,228
other

157
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:25,774
side

158
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:26,320
of

159
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,867
the

160
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:27,413
house.

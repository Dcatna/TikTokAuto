219
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:50,636
electric.

220
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:51,141
The

221
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:51,647
couch

222
00:01:51,647 --> 00:01:52,152
creaked,

223
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:52,657
drawing

224
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:53,162
our

225
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:53,667
attention.

226
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:54,173
I

227
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:54,678
turned,

228
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:55,183
just

229
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:55,688
in

230
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:56,193
time

231
00:01:56,193 --> 00:01:56,699
to

232
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,204
see

233
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:57,709
her

234
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:58,214
carefully

235
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:58,719
lean

236
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,225
in,

237
00:01:59,225 --> 00:01:59,730
capturing

238
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,235

239
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:00,740

240
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,245

241
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:01,750

242
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,256

243
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:02,761

244
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,266
passionate

245
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:03,771
kiss.

246
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:04,276
I

247
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:04,782
smiled,

248
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:05,287
thanking

249
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:05,792

250
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,297
lucky

251
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:06,802

253
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:07,813

254
00:02:07,813 --> 00:02:08,318
was

255
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:08,823

256
00:02:08,823 --> 00:02:09,328
my

257
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:09,834
life

258
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:10,339
and

259
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:10,844

260
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:11,349

261
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:11,854

262
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:12,360
